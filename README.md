# Typeblr

Work in progress! Will hopefully end up being a replacement for the [outdated official tumblr JS lib](https://github.com/tumblr/tumblr.js) that doesn't supply type information nor seems to support OAuth2.

This one will probably only support OAuth2 (and plain bot token requests), but if I manage to complate that functionality enough, I might try my hand at support for OAuth1.0a.
